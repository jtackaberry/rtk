# Introduction

rtk (**R**EAPER **T**ool**k**it, but stylized as lowercase `rtk`) is a GUI and utility
library for [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) written in Lua whose design is loosely
inspired by [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/), with some aspects borrowed from HTML and CSS.
rtk was written for [Reaticulate](https://reaticulate.com), but it is usable by any
script.

The **@{tutorial}** is the best place to get started coding with rtk.

Visit the [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/jtackaberry/rtk) for original
source code and issue tracking.

## Download

**ðŸ‘‰ [Download the latest release](https://reapertoolkit.dev/download/rtk.lua).**

While rtk's source code is comprised of many individual files, it is released as a single
bundled file for easier distribution by script writers.

You can choose to distribute `rtk.lua` alongside your application, or you can also
@{bundle|use rtk's bundler} to combine your script files with rtk to produce a single
script file that can be executed directly by Reaper without needing to fiddle with Lua
package paths.  The resulting script will be fairly large (over 200KB) as rtk itself is
not a small project, but not so large that it becomes problematic for your users.

## Features

Some of rtk's key features are:

* support for fluid layouts -- no fixed coordinates needed (although possible if desired)
* a flexible box model that will be familiar to web developers
* Retina/high-DPI friendly, with fully scalable UI, including support for multi-resolution
  image packs that dynamically picks the best resolution for the current scale
* support for touch screens with kinetic touch-scrolling
* a rich and customizable event handling system
* enhanced window management (using the js_ReaScriptAPI extension if available) with a
  unified coordinate system on all platforms
* an animation subsystem that allows animating many different widget attributes
* support for light and dark themes, adapting to the user's REAPER theme
* a featureful logging module to improve your debugging and benchmarking experience
* comprehensive API documentation

Currently the widget set is a bit anemic but more are planned as the project matures.


## Requirements

REAPER 6 is recommended due to test coverage.  REAPER 5.975 and later is expected to work,
however the level of testing on these older versions isn't as strong as REAPER 6.

The [SWS](https://www.sws-extension.org/) and
[js_ReaScriptAPI](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=212174) extensions are
recommended but not required.  rtk will work with either or both, and when present much
more functionality is available.  The APIs are appropriately documented when an extension
is required, and it's up to you as a script author to use or avoid these APIs, and if
necessary pass along the extension requirement(s) to your users.


## Hello World

Here's a simple example to give you a flavor of what rtk looks like:

```lua
-- This boilerplate is needed to tell Lua where to find rtk.lua. Here
-- it assumes rtk.lua is in the same directory as your script.  See
-- the Tutorial for a bit more context.
local path = ({reaper.get_action_context()})[2]:match('^.+[\\//]')
package.path = string.format('%s?.lua;%s?/init.lua', path, path)
-- Now we can import the rtk library.
local rtk = require('rtk')

-- Create an rtk.Window object that is to be the main application window
local window = rtk.Window()
-- Create a new button initialized with this label.  Note the curly braces,
-- because all rtk.Widget classes actually receive a table of attributes
-- upon initialization.  This one is a special "positional" value that
-- corresponds to the 'label' attribute.
local button = rtk.Button{'Fool me once, shame on ... you'}
-- Add an onclick handler to respond to mouse clicks of the button
button.onclick = function(self, event)
    -- Animate the button color to red and change the label.
    button:animate{'color', dst='red'}
    button:attr('label', "Fool me--can't get fooled again!")
end
-- Add the button widget to window, centered within it.  In practice you
-- would probably use a series of box container widgets to craft a layout.
window:add(button, {halign='center', valign='center'})
-- Finally open the window.
window:open()
```
